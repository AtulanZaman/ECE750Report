\section{Future Work}
Make interprocedural analysis. Run the  analysis on multiple programs and compare performance and other good stuff.
%Right now it does intra
%I want it to do interprocedural with call graph.
%It needs to do program transformation for call sites and the object mutator and constructor
%Metrics to compare.
	%Run it against common java libraries and see %of objects that are immutable, and % of objects that can transformed to immutable
	%Run it against performance intensive libraries and see the actual performance improvement
